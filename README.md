Veterinary Drug Dosage Calculation System

This project is developed to help veterinarians easily calculate drug dosages for cats and dogs. Dosages are automatically calculated based on the animal species, weight, and the concentration of the medications.

Features:
Calculation by Animal Species and Weight: Drug dosages for cats and dogs are automatically calculated according to the animal's weight and type of medication.
Different Concentrations: Dosage calculations can be made based on different concentrations of medications.
JSON Data Structure: Medications and dosages are defined using a flexible JSON data structure, which can be easily updated.
With this system, veterinarians can quickly and accurately calculate drug dosages, optimizing treatment for their patients.
